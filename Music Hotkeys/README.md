# Music Hotkeys

Solution for the lack of media buttons on my Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro. Maps `Home`, `End`, `PgUp`, `PgDn` (which are in a column on the right side of my keyboard) to media controls.

## ⚠ Requires AutoIt Beta!
The script uses the Map type, which is only available in beta versions of AutoIt. Compiling the script with a non-beta AutoIt compiler will result in an error. 

## Mapping
`Home` ➜ Play/Pause

`End` ➜ Previous track

`PgUp` ➜ Next track

`PgDn` ➜ Deactivate hotkeys

`Ctrl` + `Home` ➜ Activate hotkeys

You can also double click any of the keys to use its primary function without deactivating the hotkeys.

Hotkeys are stored in an array at the beginning of the code and can be easily changed to your liking.
