# Music Hotkeys

Solution for the lack of media buttons on my Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro. Maps `Home`, `End`, `PgUp`, `PgDn` (which are in a column on the right side of my keyboard) to media controls.

## Mapping
`Home` ➜ Play/Pause

`End` ➜ Previous track

`PgUp` ➜ Next track

`PgDn` ➜ Deactivate hotkeys

`Ctrl` + `Home` ➜ Activate hotkeys

You can also double click any of the keys to use its primary function without deactivating the hotkeys.
