# AutoHotkey

A couple of my AutoIt & AutoHotkey scripts that make my life easier.

Every folder containts the source code (.au3/.ahk), a compiled .exe and a more detailed description.

### Support

If you use my scripts and they make your life easier, too, consider [**buying me a beer**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nizioleque).

## Description

### [Always on Top](Always%20on%20Top)
Pins a window to stay always on top. A pinned window becomes semi-transparent when unactive. Hotkey (default: `Ctrl + Q`) and transparency can be adjusted through the tray icon menu. 

### [Horizontal Scroll](Horizontal%20Scroll)
Maps `Shift + Scroll` to horizontal scroll. Extremely useful in OneNote without a touchpad/touchscreen. Unfortunately, some apps don't support horizontal scrolling at all (eg. MS Paint).

### [Mouse XButtons](Mouse%20XButtons)
Window switching with mouse `Back`/`Forward` buttons. Hold `RMB`[^1] ➜ click `Back`/`Forward` to choose window ➜ release `RMB`. You can also select a window by moving the cursor and clicking on the the window's preview.

### [Music Hotkeys](Music%20Hotkeys)
Solution for the lack of media buttons on my Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro. Maps `Home`, `End`, `PgUp`, `PgDn` (which are in a column on the right side of my keyboard) to media controls.

### MX Master Gesture AltTab
