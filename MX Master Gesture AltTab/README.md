# MX Master Gesture AltTab

Quick window switching with the Logitech MX Master's gesture button.

Hold the gesture button ➜ move the cursor to the desired window ➜ release the gesture button. You can also release immediately to switch to the last window.

The mouse cursor is automatically moved to the middle of the screen when the button is pressed and then to the middle of the active window when the button is released.

### Known bugs:

- The cursor position is set incorrectly when the selected window is minimized. Fix coming soon(ish)...
