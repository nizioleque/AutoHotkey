# Mouse XButtons
Window switching with mouse `Back`/`Forward` buttons. Hold `RMB`[^1] ➜ click `Back`/`Forward` to choose window ➜ release `RMB`. You can also select a window by moving the cursor and clicking on the the window's preview.

Primary use case: switching windows with your right hand while eating with your left hand.

A more advanced sequel to this script for my new MX Master is available at [MX Master Gesture AltTab](../MX%20Master%20Gesture%20AltTab).
